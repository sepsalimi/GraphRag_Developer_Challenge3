# Explanatory Memorandum
## For Decree-Law No. 65 of 2025

Amending the Penal Code <orig>قانون الجزاء</orig> issued by Law No. (16) of 1960. The penal punishment stipulated by law is considered a cornerstone in building the general theory of crime. This punishment is keenly observed by the legislator and the judge, and it is relied upon by the hearts of citizens and residents alike; for without it, the articles of law would be nothing more than moral advice, heeded by those who wish and defied by those who wish.

For punishment to achieve its purpose of instilling security and tranquility in society and quenching the thirst for justice in the judiciary, it must reach a level where individuals are deterred and compelled to think carefully before engaging in wrongful conduct or refraining from an act commanded by the legislator.

The accompanying draft Decree-Law <orig>المرسوم بقانون</orig> has been introduced to amend the Penal Code <orig>قانون الجزاء</orig>, aiming for the following:
- Firstly: Addressing the decline in caution and prudence among individuals and the resulting injuries and deaths.
- Secondly: Protecting the credit process in the country from debtors who misrepresent their true financial position and attempt to portray it as a state of insolvency.
- Firstly: Manslaughter <orig>القتل الخطأ</orig> and Accidental Injury <orig>الإصابة الخطأ</orig>. It is evident that the crimes of manslaughter and accidental injury have not undergone any amendment since the issuance of the Penal Code <orig>قانون الجزاء</orig> in 1960, neither in terms of increasing the financial values of the fine penalty nor in terms of introducing aggravating circumstances when associated with the material element constituting both crimes. This is despite what reality reveals regarding a breach in the aspect of caution and prudence among individuals and their lack of deep insight into the actions they undertake and their consequences, especially if it results in multiple deaths or permanent disability. Justice refuses to treat all assumptions equally.

Therefore, the accompanying draft proposes raising the maximum fine penalty in Articles (154) and (164), and adding one form of error, which is non-observance of laws, in both mentioned articles and Article (44) in its first paragraph, to eliminate any dispute raised regarding its omission.

The draft also added two new articles, (154 bis) and (164 bis), which address the aggravating circumstances for the crimes of manslaughter <orig>القتل الخطأ</orig> and accidental injury <orig>الإصابة الخطأ</orig>. These circumstances can be categorized into three sections: the first relates to the gravity of the error, the second relates to the gravity of the criminal outcome, and the third relates to the combination of more than one party connected to the gravity of the error or the gravity of the harm, or both, as follows:
### Circumstances related to the gravity of the error:
1- That the perpetrator consumes an intoxicating, narcotic, psychotropic, or any other substance that affects the person's natural faculties, and is under its influence while committing the act described as an error. The reason for considering it grave is that intoxication, narcosis, or influence on the mind or any other faculties concerned with directing will, reduces awareness and weakens a person's control over their will, thereby diminishing the accused's ability to take precautions and caution that, if followed, would not have

## Article (284):
Anyone who receives, obtains, possesses, or has transferred to them the debtor's funds, whether by traditional or electronic means, with knowledge of the debt established by an executive instrument, with the intent of enabling the debtor to avoid payment, shall be punished with the same penalty specified in the preceding article. This provision does not apply to persons under the guardianship or tutelage of the debtor.

The criminal case shall lapse, regardless of its stage, if the funds are handed over to the Enforcement Department <orig>إدارة التنفيذ</orig> or the investigation authority <orig>جهة التحقيق</orig> in preparation for the recovery of the debt from the debtor according to the rules of creditor priority.

If the funds are handed over after a final judgment of conviction has been issued, the court that issued the judgment may order the suspension of the execution of the imposed penalty upon the request of the convicted person.

The effect of debt payment, settlement, or pardon stipulated in the preceding article shall apply to anyone who received, obtained, possessed, or had transferred to them the debtor's funds.

## Article (285):
Any debtor who disposes of their assets or rights for less than their market price or value, with a noticeable difference, intending thereby not to fulfill their debts established by an executive instrument, shall be punished by imprisonment for a period not exceeding two years and a fine not exceeding three thousand Dinars <orig>دينار</orig>, or by one of these two penalties.

The effect of debt payment, settlement, or pardon stipulated in Article (283) shall apply to the accused in accordance with the provisions of this article.

## Article (286):
The Public Prosecution <orig>النيابة العامة</orig> shall have jurisdiction over the investigation, disposition, and prosecution of the crimes mentioned in this section.

## (Article Four)
Ministers – each within their respective jurisdiction – shall implement this Decree-Law <orig>المرسوم بقانون</orig>, and it shall be published in the Official Gazette <orig>الجريدة الرسمية</orig>.

## Explanatory Memorandum <orig>المذكرة الإيضاحية</orig>
### Regarding Decree-Law No. 66 of 2025 Approving Accession to the Agreement Establishing the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank <orig>البنك الآسيوي للاستثمار في البنية التحتية</orig>

Given the importance of regional cooperation to sustain growth and promote economic and social development for economies in Asia, and thereby contribute to regional resilience against potential financial crises and other external shocks, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank <orig>البنك الآسيوي للاستثمار في البنية التحتية</orig> was established through the aforementioned Agreement.

The Preamble stated that the establishment of the Bank as a multilateral financial institution focused on infrastructure development would help mobilize much-needed additional resources from within and outside Asia and remove financing bottlenecks faced by individual economies in Asia.

Chapter One included the purpose, functions, and membership, where it clarified

And he did it. It goes without saying that the text does not apply to those who consume such substances by force or without knowledge, as it is considered that the grounds for exemption from liability stipulated in Article (23) of the Penal Code <orig>قانون الجزاء</orig> would be available to them.

2- An aggravating circumstance <orig>الظرف المشدد</orig> is present if the accused, at the time of committing the incident, refrained from or neglected to assist the victim of the crime in any way; including seeking assistance for them. This circumstance assumes that the accused was able to prevent the criminal outcome, either by their own means or by seeking assistance from others, but failed to do so and showed disregard for it, leaving it uncared for, or neglected to take action to assist. The aggravation stipulates that the accused added a second error to their initial act, represented by their failure to avert the harmful effects of their wrongful conduct.

Circumstances related to the gravity of the criminal outcome:
These are either the multiplicity of victims in involuntary manslaughter <orig>جريمة القتل غير العمد</orig> or if the accused's act resulted in injury to two or more persons or permanent disability. Although the multiplicity of victims in involuntary manslaughter or accidental injury would lead to a multiplicity of crimes committed by the perpetrator, the draft law deemed it appropriate to add the multiplicity of victims as an aggravating circumstance <orig>ظرف مشدد</orig>, which in this case prevents the multiplicity of crimes, and thus there is one crime with multiple victims.

Circumstances related to the combination of more than one aggravating circumstance:
This also applies if two or more of the circumstances mentioned in Articles (154) bis and (164) bis are present.

Secondly: Crimes related to a Debtor's Nearness to Payment <orig>جرائم قرب المدين من الوفاء</orig>
The draft law introduced a new section in Chapter Three (Crimes Against Property) of Book Three (Crimes Against Individuals) of the Penal Code <orig>قانون الجزاء</orig> under the heading (8) "Crimes related to a Debtor's Nearness to Payment <orig>قرب المدين من الوفاء</orig>", adding four new articles from (283) to (286) concerning a debtor who seeks to weaken their financial solvency and present it as a state of insolvency, intending to evade payment of debts established by executive instruments, or to dispose of assets for less than their market value with a significant, unforgivable difference. The draft law also extended criminal protection to the debtor's assets that are transferred or delivered to other parties who are aware of the debt established by the executive instrument and for which enforcement procedures are being taken to collect it, with the intention of enabling the debtor to avoid paying their debts, even if these parties are their spouse, ascendants, or descendants, with the exception of persons under the debtor's guardianship or tutelage, as liability does not extend to them given that the management of their assets is entrusted to the debtor. The draft law stipulated the effect of debt payment on criminal proceedings and settlement procedures issued by the creditor. It assigned the Public Prosecution <orig>النيابة العامة</orig> the jurisdiction to investigate, dispose of, and prosecute these crimes.

Thus, the draft law came as an affirmation of the protection of individuals' lives and credit operations in the country, signaling the necessity of clear and unambiguous dignity for the crimes associated with the accompanying draft, and as a deterrent to those who violate its provisions, achieving a balance between protecting the interests of society and ensuring the rights and freedoms of individuals.

Finally, it was decided that the provisions of the draft law shall come into effect one month after the date of its publication in the Official Gazette <orig>الجريدة الرسمية</orig>, in accordance with the text of Article (178) of the Constitution <orig>الدستور</orig>.

2. At the time a country ceases to be a member, the Bank shall arrange for the repurchase of such country's shares by the Bank as a part of the settlement of accounts with such country in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article. For this purpose, the repurchase price of the shares shall be the value shown by the books of the Bank on the date the country ceases to be a member.
3. The payment for shares repurchased by the Bank under this Article shall be governed by the following conditions:
    (i) Any amount due to the country concerned for its shares shall be withheld so long as that country, its central bank or any of its agencies, instrumentalities or political subdivisions remains liable, as borrower, guarantor or other contracting party with respect to equity investment or other financing, to the Bank and such amount may, at the option of the Bank, be applied on any such liability as it matures.

In any event, no amount due to a member for its shares shall be paid until six (6) months after the date on which the country ceases to be a member.
    (ii) Payments for shares may be made from time to time, upon surrender of the corresponding stock certificates by the country concerned, to the extent by which the amount due as the repurchase price in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article exceeds the aggregate amount of liabilities, on loans, guarantees, equity investments and other financing referred to in sub-paragraph (i) of this paragraph, until the former member has received the full repurchase price.

    independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the
    dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base.
5.  Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other
    Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by a company which is not
    a resident of that other State, unless the dividends are effectively connected with a permanent establishment
    or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor shall it subject the company's undistributed profits to a tax on
    the company's undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or

2- Nevertheless, such royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the royalties is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10% of the gross amount of the royalties.

3- The term "royalties" as used in this Article means payments of any kind received as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic or scientific work including satellite programs, any patent, trademark, design or plan or model, design or formula, secret diagram or combination or production process, or for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial or scientific equipment, or for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience.

4- The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise through a permanent establishment situated therein, and the business or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.

5- Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State if the payer is a resident of that State. Nevertheless, where the person paying the royalties, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment in connection with which the obligation to pay the royalties was incurred, and such royalties are borne by such permanent establishment, then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated.

6- Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner of the royalties, or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties, having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such a case, the excess part of the payments shall be taxable according to the laws of each of the Contracting States, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement.

Article 23

## Provisions of the Tax Agreement

- Tax types shall be eliminated according to the agreement and in accordance with the following provisions of this Article:

a) In the case of Kuwait:

When a resident of Kuwait derives income or owns capital in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, and such income or capital may be taxed in San Marino, Kuwait shall allow as a deduction from the income tax on that resident an amount equal to the income tax paid in San Marino, and shall deduct from the capital tax on that resident an amount equal to the capital tax paid in San Marino.

However, such deduction shall in either case not exceed that part of the tax on income or capital, as computed before the deduction is granted, which is attributable to the income or capital which may be taxed in San Marino.

b) In the case of San Marino:

When a resident of San Marino owns elements of income or capital subject to tax in Kuwait, San Marino, in determining the tax on income or capital as specified in Article 2 of this Agreement, may include in the basis upon which such taxes are applied, the part of the income or capital, unless otherwise provided in this Agreement.

In such a case, San Marino shall deduct from the taxes computed on these taxable elements of income or capital paid in Kuwait, which is paid or due for payment in Kuwait, an amount equal to the amount of tax paid on these elements of income or capital in Kuwait, in full or in part.

Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, where a person other than
an agent of an independent status to whom paragraph 8 applies, is acting on behalf
of an enterprise and has, and habitually exercises, in a Contracting State an
authority to conclude contracts in the name of the enterprise, that enterprise shall
be deemed to have a permanent establishment in that State in respect of any
activities which that person undertakes for the enterprise, unless the activities of
such person are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 5 which, if exercised
through a fixed place of business, would not make this fixed place of business a
permanent establishment under the provisions of this paragraph.

8. An enterprise of Contracting State shall not be deemed to have a permanent
establishment in the other Contracting State merely because it carries on business
in that State through a broker, general commission agent or any other agent of an
independent status, provided that such persons are acting in the ordinary course
of their business. However, when the activities of such an agent are devoted
wholly or almost wholly on behalf of that enterprise and other enterprises, or faces
are controlled by it or have a controlling interest in it, he shall not be considered
an agent of an independent status within the meaning of this paragraph.

9. The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is
controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or
which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent
establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a
permanent establishment of the other.

3. In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as
deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent
establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so
incurred, whether in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or
elsewhere, taking into consideration any applicable law or regulations.

4. Insofar as it has been customary in a Contracting State to determine the profits to
be attributed to a permanent establishment on the basis of an apportionment of the
total profits of the enterprise to its various parts, nothing in paragraph 2 shall
preclude that Contracting State from determining the profits to be taxed by such
an apportionment as may be customary; the method of apportionment adopted
shall, however, be such that the result shall be in accordance with the principles
contained in this Article.

5. No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere
purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the
enterprise.

6. For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed to the
permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year
unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary.

7. Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other
Articles of this Agreement, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be
affected by the provisions of this Article.

  It is agreed that double taxation shall be avoided in accordance with the following paragraphs of this Article:
    a) In the case of Kuwait
        Where a resident of Kuwait derives income or capital, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, may be taxed in both Kuwait and San Marino. Kuwait shall allow as a deduction from the tax on the income or capital of that resident, an amount equal to the income or capital tax paid in San Marino.

        Such deduction in either case shall not, however, exceed that part of the tax on income or capital, as computed before the deduction is given, which is attributable, as the case may be, to the income or capital, which may be taxed in San Marino.

    b) In the case of San Marino
        Where a resident of San Marino owns items of income or capital which are taxable in Kuwait, San Marino, in determining its tax on income or capital specified in Article 2 of this Agreement, may exclude in the basis upon which such taxes are imposed the said items of income or capital, unless specific provisions of this Agreement otherwise provide.

        In such case, San Marino shall deduct from the taxes so calculated the tax on income or capital paid in Kuwait, but in an amount not exceeding that proportion of the aforesaid San Marino tax, which such items of income or capital bear to the entire income or capital.

San Marino law.
2. Where in accordance with any provision of the Agreement income or capital
derived by a resident of a Contracting State is exempt from tax in that State, such
State may nevertheless, in calculating the amount of tax on the remaining income
or capital of such resident, take into account the exempted income or capital.
3. For the purposes of allowance as a credit in a Contracting State, the tax paid in
the other Contracting State shall include the tax which is otherwise payable in that
other Contracting State, but has been waived or reduced in accordance with the
special investment incentive law or measures designed to promote economic
development in the other Contracting State.

## Article 24
### Non-Discrimination

1. Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting
State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or
more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which
nationals of that other State in the same circumstances, in particular with respect
to residence, are or may be subjected.
2. The taxation on a permanent establishment, which an enterprise of a Contracting
State has in the other Contracting State, shall not be less favourably levied in that
other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on
the same activities in the same circumstances. This provision shall not be
construed as obliging a Contracting State to grant to residents of the other
Contracting State any personal allowances, reliefs, and reductions for taxation

Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting States.
3.  The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Agreement.

The Paris Declaration on the International Solar Alliance <orig>التحالف الدولي للطاقة الشمسية</orig> issued on 30 November 2015, and the shared ambition to achieve the joint efforts required to reduce the cost of financing and the cost of technology, and to mobilize more than 1000 billion US dollars in investments required by 2030 for the widespread deployment of solar energy, and to pave the way for future technologies that adapt to needs,

And recognizing that solar energy provides developing countries with solar energy resources, located wholly or partially within the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, an unprecedented opportunity to achieve prosperity, energy security, and sustainable development for their peoples,

And recognizing the specific and common obstacles that still hinder the rapid and massive expansion of solar energy in these countries,

We affirm that these obstacles can be addressed through consistent cooperation among countries rich in solar energy resources, with a strong and resolute political impetus, and that better coordination and aggregation of demand for solar energy financing, technologies, innovation, or capacity building across countries will lead to the achievement of this goal, and that providing training programs to secure cost-effective and high-quality solutions, and to provide reliable and affordable solar energy accessible to all,

Motivated by their desire to establish an effective tool for coordination and decision-making among themselves,

Have agreed as follows:

(6) If a Contracting Party wishes to suspend or amend an operating authorization granted to an air transport enterprise of the other Contracting Party, other than what is concluded that such immediate action is necessary to ensure the safety of the air transport enterprise's operations, based on what may appear to be a suspicion of safety operation or a series of safety operations, or a refusal to permit such inspection, or what may appear from any consultations being conducted.
(7) Any action taken by one of the Contracting Parties under paragraphs (2) and (6) shall be suspended if the basis for taking such action so requires.
(8) Certificates of airworthiness – and certificates of competency and licenses issued or validated by one Contracting Party, and remaining in force, shall be recognized as valid by the other Contracting Party for the purpose of operating the air services permitted by this Agreement, provided that the requirements under which such certificates and licenses were issued or validated are equal to or higher than the minimum standards established or to be established pursuant to the Convention. Nevertheless, neither Contracting Party shall believe in refusing to recognize the validity of certificates of competency and licenses for the purpose of extra-territorial flights granted or recognized in favor of its nationals by the other Contracting Party or in any other state.
(9) If the aeronautical authorities of a Contracting Party issue an authorization to a specific person or air transport enterprise(s) concerning the financing and training referred to in paragraph (8) of this Article, in relation to a phenomenon where the operator of the agreed services operates on the specified routes, and these rights or conditions are registered with the International Civil Aviation Organization <orig>منظمة الطيران المدني الدولي</orig> but are permitted by agreement of international standards under the Convention, then the aeronautical authorities of the other Contracting Party may request consultations with the aeronautical authorities of the first Contracting Party, in accordance with the provisions of Article (17) of this Agreement, with the aim of reaching an agreement that those rights and conditions are in force. After agreeing to reach a satisfactory agreement, this shall form the basis for the application of the provisions of Article (5) of this Agreement.

# ARTICLE 14
## ESTABLISHMENT OF TARIFFS

1.  Each Contracting Party shall allow tariffs for air services to be established by each designated airline based on commercial considerations in the market place, including the cost of operation, the characteristics of the service, the interests of users, a reasonable profit and other market considerations.
2.  Each Contracting Party may require notification to or filing with its aeronautical authorities of tariffs to be charged to or from its territory by airlines of the other Contracting Party. Such notification or filing by the airlines of both Contracting Parties may be required to be made no later than the initial offering of a price.
3.  Without prejudice to the applicable competition and consumer protection laws prevailing in each Contracting Party, neither Contracting Party shall take unilateral action to prevent the commencement or continuation of a tariff proposed to be charged or charged by a designated airline of the other Contracting Party in connection with the international air services provided for under this Agreement. Intervention, as described in paragraph (4) below, by the Contracting Parties shall be limited to:
    a. Prevention of unreasonably discriminatory prices or practices;
    b. Protection of consumers from prices that are unreasonably high or restrictive due to the abuse of a dominant position or due to concerted practice among airlines;
    c. Protection of airlines from prices that are artificially low.
4.  Without prejudice to the provisions of paragraph (3) of this Article, the aeronautical authorities of either Contracting Party may expressly disapprove tariffs submitted by the designated airlines of the other Contracting Party, where such aeronautical authorities find that a tariff proposed to be charged by such airlines falls within the categories set forth in paragraph (3) of this Article. In such event, the concerned aeronautical authority:
    a. Shall send notification of its dissatisfaction to the aeronautical authorities of the other Contracting Party, and to the airline involved, as soon as possible, and in no event later than thirty (30) days after the date of notification or filing of the tariff in question; and
    b. May request consultations in accordance with the procedures established under paragraph (3) of this Article. Unless both aeronautical authorities

5) The aeronautical authorities of each Contracting Party may request consultations
with the aeronautical authorities of the other Contracting Party on any tariff charged
by an airline of the other Contracting Party for international air services to or from
the territory of the first Contracting Party, including tariffs for which a notice of
dissatisfaction has been given. These consultations shall be held no later than fifteen
(15) days after receipt of the request. The aeronautical authorities of both
Contracting Parties shall cooperate in securing the necessary information for a
reasoned resolution of the issue. If an agreement is reached with respect to a tariff
for which a notice of dissatisfaction has been given, the aeronautical authorities of
each Contracting Party shall use their best efforts to put that agreement into effect.
If such mutual agreement is not reached, the tariff shall go into effect or continue in
effect.

  Each Contracting Party may request consultations at any time concerning safety standards in any area relating to aircrew, aircraft or their operation adopted by the other Contracting Party. Such consultations shall take place within thirty (30) days of that request.

2.  If, following such consultations, one Contracting Party finds that the other Contracting Party does not effectively maintain and administer safety standards in any such area that are at least equal to the minimum standards established at that time pursuant to the Convention, the first Contracting Party shall notify the other Contracting Party of those findings and the steps considered necessary to conform with those minimum standards and that other Contracting Party shall take appropriate corrective action. Failure by the other Contracting Party to take appropriate action within fifteen (15) days or such longer period as may be agreed shall be grounds for the application of Article (3) of this Agreement.

3.  Notwithstanding the obligations mentioned in Articles (16) and (33) of the Convention it is agreed that any aircraft operated by the airline or airlines of one Contracting Party on services to or from the territory of the other Contracting Party may, while within the territory of the other Contracting Party, be made the subject of an examination by the authorized representatives of the other Contracting Party, on board and around the aircraft to check both the validity of the aircraft documents and those of its crew and the apparent condition of the aircraft and its equipment (in this Article called "Ramp Inspection"), provided this does not lead to unreasonable delay.

4.  If any ramp inspection or series of ramp inspections gives rise to:
    a. Serious concerns that an aircraft or the operation of an aircraft does not comply with the minimum standards established at that time pursuant to the Convention, or
    b. Serious concerns that there is a lack of effective maintenance and administration of safety standards established at that time pursuant to the Convention;
    The Contracting Party carrying out the inspection shall, for the purposes of Article (33) of the Convention, be free to conclude that the requirements under which the certificate or licenses in respect of that aircraft or in respect of the crew of that

airline or airlines may be required to observe the aviation security provisions
referred to in paragraph (3) required by the other Contracting Party for entrance
into, departure from, or while within, the territory of that other Contracting Party.
Each Contracting Party shall also act favourably upon any request from the other
Contracting Party for reasonable special security measures to meet a particular
threat.

5) When an incident or threat of an incident of unlawful seizure of civil aircraft or
other unlawful acts against the safety of such aircraft, their passengers and crew,
airports or air navigation facilities occurs, the Contracting Parties shall assist each
other by facilitating communications and other appropriate measures intended to
terminate as rapidly as possible commensurate with minimum risk to life such
incident or threat.

6) Each Contracting Party shall take such measures, as it may find practicable, to
ensure that an aircraft subject to an act of unlawful seizure or other acts of unlawful
interference which has landed in its territory is detained on the ground unless its
departure is necessitated by the overriding duty to protect human life. Wherever
practicable, such measures shall be taken on the basis of mutual consultations.

7) When a Contracting Party has reasonable grounds to believe that the other
Contracting Party has departed from the provisions of this Article, the first
Contracting Party may request immediate consultations. Such consultations shall
start within fifteen (15) days of receipt of such a request from either Contracting
Party. Failure to reach a satisfactory agreement within fifteen (15) days from the
start of consultations, or such other period as may be agreed upon between the
Contracting Parties, shall constitute grounds for withholding, revoking, suspending
or imposing conditions on the authorisations of the airline or airlines designated by
the other Contracting Party. When justified by an emergency, or to prevent further
non-compliance with the provisions of this Article, the first Contracting Party may
take interim action at any time. Any action taken in accordance with this paragraph
shall be discontinued upon compliance by the other Contracting Party with the
security provisions of this Article.

Filed by: Commercial Bank of Kuwait <orig>البنك التجاري الكويتي</orig>
Against: Gulf Insurance Company <orig>شركة الخليج للتأمين</orig>

## Facts

Whereas the facts – as evident from the referral judgment and all other documents – indicate that the plaintiff bank (Commercial Bank of Kuwait <orig>البنك التجاري الكويتي</orig>) filed lawsuit No. (18492) for the year 2021, Commercial Plenary /32, against the defendant company (Gulf Insurance Company <orig>شركة الخليج للتأمين</orig>), requesting a judgment obliging it to pay the amount of (K.D. 43,498.951) along with any accrued contractual interest at a rate of (3%) annually above the discount rate announced by the Central Bank <orig>البنك المركزي</orig> from the date of the notice of payment on 6/10/2019 until the full and final settlement of the debt. This was based on the assertion that, pursuant to a loan agreement dated 8/10/2018, Saeed Munif Saeed Al-Mutairi <orig>سعيد منيف سعيد المطيري</orig> obtained a personal loan of (K.D. 42,000) deposited into his account with the bank, to be repaid in (180) monthly installments of (K.D. 355) each. However, on 18/1/2019, the aforementioned client passed away after repaying part of the debt. Since the bank had insured the lives of its borrowers under a group insurance policy with the appellant company, and the insured risk materialized with the death of the borrowing client, leaving an outstanding amount of (K.D. 43,498.951) from the principal loan and accrued interest, the bank notified the company and instructed it to pay on 6/10/2019. However, the company refused to pay, leading the bank to file the present lawsuit with the aforementioned requests.
On 30/5/2023, the first instance court ruled to dismiss the lawsuit. The plaintiff bank appealed this judgment with appeal No. (4231) for the year 2023, Commercial /19. The defendant company submitted a memorandum in which it argued
President of the Court
Session Secretary
the unconstitutionality of the third paragraph of Article (791) of the Civil Code <orig>القانون المدني</orig> regarding its provision obliging the insurer to pay the insurance amount and depriving him of the right to request the annulment of the contract if the truth emerged after the risk materialized, without differentiating between the good-faith insured and the bad-faith insured, in violation of Articles (7) and (8) of the Constitution. On 9/1/2024, the Court of Appeal ruled to suspend the appeal proceedings and refer it to the Constitutional Court <orig>المحكمة الدستورية</orig> to decide on the constitutionality of the third paragraph of Article (791) of the Civil Code <orig>القانون المدني</orig>.
Following the arrival of the case file at the clerk's office of this Court, it was registered under No. (1) for the year 2024 "Constitutional," and the concerned parties were notified accordingly.
This Court heard the lawsuit in its session on 5/2/2025, as detailed in its minutes. The plaintiff, on behalf of the defendant, submitted a memorandum concluding with a request for a judgment of inadmissibility of the lawsuit, and alternatively, its rejection. The representative for the defendant submitted a memorandum concluding with a request for a judgment of unconstitutionality of the challenged text. The Department of Fatwa and Legislation <orig>إدارة الفتوى والتشريع</orig> submitted a memorandum on behalf of the government's defense, concluding with a request for a judgment of inadmissibility of the lawsuit, and alternatively, its rejection. The Court decided to issue its judgment in the session today.

## Reasoning

After reviewing the documents, hearing the pleadings, and deliberating.
Whereas the referral procedures have fulfilled their legally prescribed conditions.
Whereas Article (791) of the Civil Code <orig>القانون المدني</orig> stipulates that: "1- The insurance contract shall be voidable in favor of the insurer if the insured remained silent about a matter or provided an incorrect statement, and this was likely to change the subject of the risk or reduce its importance in the insurer's view. 2- If the truth was revealed before the risk materialized, the insurer may request the annulment of the contract after ten days from the date of notifying the insured by registered letter, unless the latter accepts an increase in the premium proportionate to the increase in the risk. The annulment of the contract in this case entails that the insurer returns the insurance consideration or returns the amount for which no risk was borne. 3- However, if the truth appeared after the risk materialized, the insurance amount must be reduced by the ratio of the premium rates actually paid to the premium rates that should have been paid if the risks had been correctly declared to the insurer."
Whereas the basis of the complaint against the third paragraph of the aforementioned Article – as evident from the referral judgment – is that it equated the good-faith insured and the bad-faith insured in the event of providing incorrect data and the truth appearing after the risk materialized, as both are compensated without differentiation according to the proportional rule, thereby depriving the insurer of his right to request the annulment of the contract, whereas the application of that rule should have been limited to the good-faith insured only, which violates Articles (7) and (8) of the Constitution.
Whereas this complaint is refutable, as it is established – and as the jurisprudence of this Court has held – that the discretionary power possessed by the legislator in accordance with

The legislator, in this regard, took into account that the insurer, as the stronger party in the insurance contract, has the right to include any conditions it wishes in the insurance contract to define the scope of the insured risk and the conditions of its coverage. The insured, on the other hand, has no choice but to accept these conditions, as long as they do not violate the law, in addition to the insurer's right to take all necessary measures to verify the accuracy of the data provided by the insured. If the contract is concluded according to the conditions set by the insurer, and after verifying the accuracy of the data submitted by the insured, and the contract continues until the risk materializes, and then the inaccuracy of some of this data becomes apparent, the legislator, in this case, deemed it appropriate to allow the contract to remain in force and its effects to be arranged, with a reduction in the insurance amount that the insurer is obligated to pay, in proportion to that. The matter was left to the judiciary to estimate this proportion in a way that achieves justice between the two parties, so that the legislative regulation envisioned by the legislator in this regard does not violate Articles (7) and (8) of the Constitution <orig>الدستور</orig>.

It goes without saying in this context that the judicial oversight exercised by this Court, which the legislator has entrusted to it, does not extend to replacing a new ruling with the ruling contained in the challenged legislative text or supplementing its ruling with another ruling. Rather, its oversight is limited to taking the apparent meaning of the challenged text as a basis for examining its constitutionality, considering that the review of this Court is a constitutional review, not one of expediency. Furthermore, the presumption of constitutionality accompanying legislation assumes the conformity of legislative texts with the provisions of the Constitution <orig>الدستور</orig>, and every possible presumption should be in favor of the legislation unless this presumption is rebutted by conclusive evidence that, in itself, definitively negates the constitutionality of the challenged text, which is not realized in the present constitutional case.

Consequently, based on the foregoing, it is necessary to rule to dismiss the case.

For these reasons,
The Court ruled: to dismiss the case.

President of the Court
Session Secretary

for the Constitution <orig>الدستور</orig>, is based – in essence – on choosing between different alternatives that compete among themselves to regulate a specific matter. It only selects what it deems – according to its assessment – more suitable than others to achieve the objectives it seeks. Whenever the legislative regulation is logically linked to these objectives – and assuming its legality – this regulation is in conformity with the Constitution <orig>الدستور</orig>. This Court may not interfere in a matter that is inherently within the work of the legislative authority in this manner, nor weigh with its subjective standards the legislative policy adopted by the legislator on a specific matter, nor discuss it, or delve into the expediency of its practical application, nor evaluate the legislator's choices as long as it has been established that the legislator has exercised its powers, inspired by objectives required by the public interest regarding the subject of the legislative regulation.

Given that, and since the legislator regulated the insurance contract in the Civil Code <orig>القانون المدني</orig> in Articles (773) to (809), the provisions of these articles – as disclosed by the Explanatory Memorandum of the Law – collectively aim to protect the insured. Article (808) thereof did not permit the treatment or amendment of its provisions unless it was in the interest of the insured or the beneficiary. In return, Article (790) of the Law placed obligations on the insured, including clearly stating, at the time of concluding the contract, all known circumstances that are important for the insurer to know in order to assess the risks it undertakes, considering that the insured risk is the essential element in insurance. Article (791) specified the penalty for breaching this obligation if the insured remained silent about a matter or provided incorrect data, and this would change the subject of the risk or reduce its importance in the insurer's view. This penalty was made the contract being voidable in the interest of the insurer, without differentiating between the good-faith insured and the bad-faith insured. However, the second paragraph of the Article limited this penalty to the case where the truth is revealed before the risk materializes, allowing the insurer to request the annulment of the contract ten days after notifying the insured by registered letter, unless the latter accepted an increase in the premium proportionate to the increase in the risk. It did not make for the annulment of the

And in the session of 2023/11/28, the Court of First Instance ruled to dismiss the lawsuit, so the plaintiff appealed its judgment in appeals numbers (3978), (3981), and (4061) for the year 2023, Administrative Contracts and Individual Appeals/4, and argued the unconstitutionality of the challenged decision. In the session of 2024/4/25, the Court of Appeal <orig>محكمة الاستئناف</orig> ruled to suspend consideration of the appeals and refer them to the Constitutional Court <orig>المحكمة الدستورية</orig> to decide on the constitutionality of Articles (1), (2), and (3) of the decision and Table No. (1) attached thereto, regarding their imposition of a fee for the treatment of medical waste, medicines, and medical consumables, in violation of Article (134) of the Constitution. Following the arrival of the case file at the Registry Department <orig>إدارة كتاب</orig> of this Court, it was registered under number (2) for the year 2024 "Constitutional", and the concerned parties were notified accordingly.

In the Name of His Highness the Amir of Kuwait
Sheikh Mishal Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah <orig>الشيخ مشعل الأحمد الجابر الصباح</orig>
### The Constitutional Judgment
In the session held publicly at the Court on 2 Dhu al-Qi'dah 1446 AH, corresponding to 30 April 2025 AD
Presided over by His Excellency Counselor / Adel Ali Al-Bahou <orig>عادل علي البحو</orig>, President of the Court
And with the membership of Their Excellencies Counselors /
Saleh Khalifa Al-Murshed <orig>صالح خليفه المرشد</orig> and Abdul Rahman Mishari Al-Darmi <orig>عبد الرحمن مشاري الدارمي</orig>
and Ibrahim Abdul Rahman Al-Saif <orig>إبراهيم عبد الرحمن السيف</orig> and Waleed Ibrahim Al-Moajel <orig>وليد إبراهيم المعجل</orig>
And in the presence of Mr. / Yousef Ahmed Ma'rafi <orig>يوسف أحمد معرفي</orig>, Session Secretary
The following judgment was issued:
In the lawsuit registered in the Constitutional Court's <orig>المحكمة الدستورية</orig> register under number (2) for the year 2024 "Constitutional"
After the Court of Appeal <orig>محكمة الاستئناف</orig> referred appeals numbers (3978), (3981), and (4061) for the year 2023, Administrative Contracts and Individual Appeals/4, filed by:
Essam Abdul Samad Mohammed Al-Saleh <orig>عصام عبد الصمد محمد الصالح</orig> on his own behalf and in his capacity as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Union of Private Medical Professions Owners <orig>اتحاد أصحاب المهن الطبية الأهلية</orig>
Against:
1 - The Undersecretary of the Ministry of Health <orig>وزارة الصحة</orig>, in his capacity.
2 - The Prime Minister <orig>رئيس مجلس الوزراء</orig>, in his capacity.
3 - The Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers <orig>مجلس الوزراء</orig>, in his capacity.
4 - The Minister of Health <orig>وزير الصحة</orig>, in his capacity.
### The Facts
Whereas the summary of the facts - as evident from the referral judgment and all other documents - is that the plaintiff (Essam Abdul Samad Mohammed Al-Saleh <orig>عصام عبد الصمد محمد الصالح</orig> on his own behalf and in his capacity) filed lawsuit No. (8080) for the year 2022, Administrative Plenary /6, against the defendants, requesting a judgment to suspend the implementation of Ministerial Decision No. (196) for the year 2022, dated 2022/5/17, to consider it null and void, and to cancel its resulting effects, on the grounds that the Minister of Health <orig>وزير الصحة</orig> issued the aforementioned challenged decision, published in the Official Gazette <orig>الجريدة الرسمية</orig> on 2022/5/29, obliging private medical sector institutions to treat medical waste resulting from their operations at the Ministry's medical waste treatment unit and by contracting with the company assigned by it. The decision prohibited granting or renewing health licenses for all private medical sector institutions except after submitting a certificate confirming a contract with that company, and since this decision contradicts the constitutionally protected right to property, and violates the provisions of Law No. (72) for the year 2020 regarding competition protection, by restricting free competition, as well as Law No. (70) for the year 2020 regarding the practice of medicine and allied professions, patient rights, and health facilities, which stipulated in Article (56) thereof that private medical sector institutions must safely dispose of medical waste without limiting this to contracting with a specific company. Furthermore, the decision was flawed due to abuse of authority by setting exorbitant costs for contracting with the company assigned by the Ministry, which would harm the interests of

This Court considered the lawsuit in the session of 2025/2/5, as detailed in its minutes, and the plaintiff appeared in person, and those present with him submitted three memoranda, at the conclusion of which they requested a judgment on the unconstitutionality of the challenged Ministerial Decision. The Fatwa and Legislation Department <orig>إدارة الفتوى والتشريع</orig> submitted a memorandum in defense of the government, requesting at its conclusion a judgment to dismiss the lawsuit, and the Court decided to issue its judgment in it in today's session.
### The Judgment
After reviewing the documents, hearing the pleadings, and deliberation.
Whereas the referral procedures have fulfilled their legally prescribed conditions.
Whereas the challenged Ministerial Decision No. (196) for the year 2022, issued on 2022/5/17 - and published in the Official Gazette <orig>الجريدة الرسمية</orig> on 2022/5/29 - stipulates in its Article (1) that: "It is prohibited to grant, issue, or renew health licenses for all types and specializations of healthcare facilities, pharmaceutical factories, warehouses, companies, and pharmacies in the private medical sector, except after submitting a certificate issued by the Hotel Services Department <orig>إدارة الخدمات الفندقية</orig> and approved by the Environmental Audit Department <orig>إدارة التدقيق البيئي</orig> of the Ministry of Health <orig>وزارة الصحة</orig>, confirming a contract with the company assigned to manage, operate, and maintain the Kabad 3 <orig>كبد 3</orig> medical waste treatment plant affiliated with the Ministry of Health <orig>وزارة الصحة</orig> for the treatment of their medical waste, medicines, and medical consumables. A grace period of (30) days is granted after the publication of the decision in the Official Gazette <orig>الجريدة الرسمية</orig> for those who obtained a license before the issuance of the decision to submit the certificate."
And Article (2) of the decision stipulates that: "The duration of the medical waste treatment contract for healthcare facilities, pharmaceutical factories, warehouses, companies, and pharmacies in the private medical sector must be the same as the duration granted for the license, according to regulatory and ministerial decisions."
And Article (3) thereof stipulates that: "The cost of treating medical waste, medicines, and medical consumables shall not exceed the maximum limit stipulated in Annex No. 1 attached to the decision."
And Annex No. (1) attached to the aforementioned decision listed the prescribed costs

Rather, it may change according to the nature of transactions in terms of their volume, quantity, or performance circumstances.
Given this, and as the Public Prosecution <orig>النيابة</orig> stated that the Ministry of Health <orig>وزارة الصحة</orig> had assigned to one of the private companies – by virtue of the contract it concluded with it after the tender was awarded to it – the tasks of managing, operating, and maintaining its medical waste treatment plant, and based on that, the Minister of Health <orig>وزير الصحة</orig> issued the challenged Ministerial Decision <orig>القرار الوزاري المطعون فيه</orig>, which prohibited the granting, issuance, or renewal of health licenses for all types and specializations of healthcare facilities, as well as pharmaceutical factories, warehouses, companies, and pharmacies in the private medical sector, except after submitting a certificate from the competent department confirming a contract with that company for the treatment of their medical waste, medicines, and medical consumables, provided that the contract duration is the same as the duration granted for the license. It was also stipulated that the cost of treating medical waste, medicines, and medical consumables agreed upon in that contract shall not exceed the maximum limit stated in the annex attached to the decision. Therefore, what the decision contained regarding the cost of treating the aforementioned waste is not considered a fee, as it is not a fixed amount that all health facilities are obligated to pay, but rather it is estimated according to purely economic considerations that take into account the nature and quantity of the waste to be treated. The true nature of this cost, as for the service requested by the medical facility from the company assigned by the Ministry of Health <orig>وزارة الصحة</orig> to manage a plant for treating its waste, does not fall within the concept of fees, which can only be established within the limits of the law. Furthermore, the challenged decision did not impose a specific charge on health facilities that they are obligated to pay to that company, but rather set an upper limit that cannot be exceeded in the contract concluded between the two parties. Consequently, the claim that the challenged decision imposed a fee on health facilities in violation of Article (134) of the Constitution <orig>الدستور</orig> is unfounded, and therefore, the court must rule to dismiss the case.
Whereas it is established – in the jurisprudence of this Court – that the scope of a constitutional case is determined by the scope of the plea of unconstitutionality raised before the trial court, and within the limits in which that court assesses its seriousness. Therefore, the Court disregards the reasons for the plea of unconstitutionality of the challenged decision presented by the plaintiff in his memoranda, and confines itself to what the trial court stated as an objection to that decision in the referral judgment, without exceeding that scope.
Whereas the basis of the objection to the aforementioned articles of the challenged Ministerial Decision <orig>قرار وزير الصحة المطعون فيه</orig> and its attached schedule – as evident from the referral judgment – is that the correct classification of the amounts listed in the schedule attached to the challenged decision is that they are, in reality, a fee prescribed for benefiting from the services of the medical waste treatment unit resulting from the private medical sector. And that the decision, by doing so, has imposed a fee for the treatment of medical waste, medicines, and medical consumables in violation of Article (134) of the Constitution <orig>الدستور</orig>, which does not permit the imposition of fees except within the limits of the law, meaning that the government's authority to impose fees can only be through a law that authorizes it to exercise this authority, otherwise its imposition would be unconstitutional.
Whereas this objection is refutable, as the import of Article (134) of the Constitution <orig>الدستور</orig> is that no one may be charged with paying fees except within the limits of the law. Fees are defined as what a public entity imposes in exchange for specific services it provides to those who request them, and their estimation does not consider the cost of the service, as their amount is generally fixed for all beneficiaries of these services, throughout the validity of the legislative instrument that imposed them. In this way, they differ from the price or service charge collected by entities responsible for managing state property, as this price or charge is paid to an economic facility managed by an entity according to economic management methods, and it is determined according to purely economic criteria. It is subject to changes imposed by the nature of economic conditions and may accommodate changes resulting from negotiations between the product or service requester and the economic facility.

For these reasons
The Court ruled: to dismiss the case.

Whereas it is established – in the jurisprudence of this Court – that litigation in a direct constitutional challenge, like all constitutional litigations, is an in rem litigation primarily directed at the legislative text challenged for unconstitutionality. Its basis is to challenge that text itself, aiming to monitor it and verify the extent of its conformity with the Constitution. The legislative text, in this regard, is the subject and object of the litigation, to which it pertains and by whose scope it is defined.
And whereas this Court, in its session held on 2025/2/5, ruled in Challenge No. (5) of 2023, a "direct constitutional challenge," "on the unconstitutionality of Clause (1) of Article (34) of Law No. (72) of 2020 concerning Competition Protection <orig>حماية المنافسة</orig>, in what it included regarding the imposition of financial penalties not exceeding ten percent (10%) of the total revenues achieved by the concerned person during the preceding fiscal year in case of violating the provisions of Articles (5), (6), (7), and (8) of this Law." And since the present challenge by the appellant was directed at the same aforementioned article, aiming for a ruling on its unconstitutionality, the litigation in this challenge consequently becomes moot, as its subject matter has ceased to exist and its cause has vanished, with that judgment fulfilling the appellant's requests. As for the challenge against the articles of the executive regulations related to the implementation of financial penalties, it has also become moot after the disappearance of the text that stipulates these penalties. Therefore, the constitutional litigation in this challenge – as is the case – is terminated, which must be declared.

Therefore,
The Court – in the Consultative Chamber <orig>غرفة المشورة</orig> – decided the termination of the litigation in the challenge.

Filed by:
The legal representative of Al-Muzaini Exchange Company <orig>شركة المزيني للصيرفة</orig>
The Court
After reviewing the documents and deliberation.
Whereas the appellant company challenged the unconstitutionality of Article (34), Clause (1) of Law No. (72) of 2020 concerning Competition Protection <orig>حماية المنافسة</orig>, and Articles (48), (49), and (50) of Decision No. (14) of 2021 regarding the issuance of the Executive Regulations of the Law. The appellant argued that Article (34), Clause (1) of the Law overlooked the principle of proportionality between the violation and the penalty or sanction prescribed for it, as imposing a financial penalty on the violating person at a rate not exceeding (10%) of the total revenues achieved during the fiscal year preceding the violation represents a financial penalty characterized by exaggeration, excessiveness, and disproportionality with the committed violation and its resulting effects. There is no connection between it and the activity for which the violation was committed, as it extends to include all revenues of the violator, regardless of their relation to that violation, which unequivocally demonstrates the harshness and excessiveness of this financial penalty and its incompatibility with justice. Furthermore, this article also violated the principle of equality by allowing the Disciplinary Council <orig>مجلس التأديب</orig> to impose different financial penalties on perpetrators of the same violation, in contravention of Articles (7), (8), and (29) of the Constitution. As for the challenged articles of the Executive Regulations, they made the decisions of the Disciplinary Council <orig>مجلس التأديب</orig> enforceable immediately upon their issuance, and in case of non-compliance, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Authority <orig>الجهاز</orig> shall submit a report to the Public Prosecution <orig>النيابة العامة</orig> in this regard, despite the Law not containing such provisions, thus creating new offenses

Whereas the appellant company <orig>الشركة الطاعنة</orig> challenged the unconstitutionality of Article (34), paragraph (1) of Law No. (72) of 2020 regarding Competition Protection <orig>قانون حماية المنافسة</orig>, and Articles (48), (49), and (50) of Resolution No. (14) of 2021 regarding the Issuance of the Executive Regulations of the Law <orig>اللائحة التنفيذية للقانون</orig>, arguing that Article (34), paragraph (1) of the Law violated the principle of proportionality between the violation and the penalty or sanction prescribed for it. This is because imposing a financial penalty on the violating person at a rate not exceeding (10%) of the total revenues achieved during the fiscal year preceding the violation represents a financial penalty characterized by exaggeration, excessiveness, and disproportionality with the committed violation and its resulting effects. Furthermore, there is no link between it and the activity for which the violation was committed, as it extends to include all revenues of the violator, regardless of their relation to that violation, which unequivocally demonstrates the harshness, excessiveness, and injustice of this financial penalty. Moreover, this article also violated the principle of equality, as it allowed the Disciplinary Council <orig>مجلس التأديب</orig> to impose different financial penalties on perpetrators of the same violation, in contravention of Articles (7), (8), and (29) of the Constitution. As for the challenged articles of the Executive Regulations, they made the decisions of the Disciplinary Council <orig>مجلس التأديب</orig> immediately enforceable upon their issuance, and in case of non-compliance, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Authority <orig>رئيس مجلس إدارة الجهاز</orig> submits a report to the Public Prosecution <orig>النيابة العامة</orig> in this regard, despite the Law not including such provisions. Thus, these regulations introduced crimes not stipulated in the Law, in contravention of Article (32) of the Constitution. The appeal had a direct personal interest in submitting its present appeal, as Disciplinary Council <orig>مجلس التأديب</orig> Decision No. (3) of 2024 was issued on 2024/7/10, fining it by (5%) of the total revenues it achieved during the previous fiscal year, for violating Article (5) of the aforementioned Law No. (72) of 2020, which prompted it to submit its present appeal.

Whereas it is established – in the jurisprudence of this Court – that litigation in a direct appeal, like all constitutional litigations, is an objective litigation <orig>خصومة عينية</orig> primarily directed at the legislative text challenged for unconstitutionality. Its basis is the competence of that text itself, aiming to monitor it and verify the extent of its conformity with the Constitution. The legislative text, in this regard, is the subject matter and locus of the litigation, to which it pertains and by whose scope it is defined.
And whereas this Court ruled in its sessions held on 2025/2/5 in Appeal No. (5) of 2023, a "Direct Constitutional Appeal" <orig>طعن مباشر دستوري</orig>, "on the unconstitutionality of paragraph (1) of Article (34) of Law No. (72) of 2020 regarding Competition Protection <orig>قانون حماية المنافسة</orig>, insofar as it included the imposition of financial penalties at a rate not exceeding ten percent (10%) of the total revenues achieved by the concerned person during the previous fiscal year in case of violating the provisions of Articles Nos. (5), (6), (7), and (8) of this Law." And since the present appeal focused on the same aforementioned article, aiming for a ruling on its unconstitutionality, the litigation in this appeal consequently becomes moot <orig>غير ذات موضوع</orig> as a result, after its subject matter ceased to exist and its cause vanished, leading that judgment to fulfill the appellant's requests. As for the challenge to the articles of the Executive Regulations related to the implementation of financial penalties, they also became without merit <orig>لا محل لها</orig> after the disappearance of the text that stipulates these penalties. Therefore, the constitutional litigation in the appeal – under these circumstances – is terminated, which must be declared.

## Therefore
**The Court, in chambers, decided the termination of the litigation in the appeal.**

During the consideration of the case in the sessions, the appellant submitted a memorandum arguing the unconstitutionality of what is stipulated in Article (125) of Law No. (7) of 2010, which penalizes "any person who falsely claims that the Authority has taken any measure or decision that it has not actually taken," due to the failure to definitively specify the criminalized acts, which prevents their confusion with others, in violation of Articles (30), (32), and (36) of the Constitution.
In the session of 16/9/2024, the Misdemeanor Court of the Capital Market <orig>سوق المال</orig> ruled that the plea of unconstitutionality was not serious, and penalized the appellant by fining him an amount of five thousand Kuwaiti Dinars <orig>دينار كويتي</orig> for the accusation attributed to him.
As the appellant was not satisfied with the ruling of the latter judgment regarding its finding that the plea of unconstitutionality was not serious, he appealed it before the Appeals Examination Committee <orig>لجنة فحص الطعون</orig> of the Constitutional Court <orig>المحكمة الدستورية</orig> with a petition filed with the Registry Department <orig>إدارة كتاب</orig> of this Court on 13/10/2024, where it was registered under No. (7) of 2024 "Appeals Examination Committee." At the conclusion of that petition, he requested the annulment of the judgment issued finding the plea of unconstitutionality not serious, and the referral of the matter to the Constitutional Court <orig>المحكمة الدستورية</orig> – in its full composition – for a decision.
This Court considered the appeal in the session of 5/2/2025, as indicated in the session minutes. The appellant appeared in person, submitted a portfolio of documents, and insisted on his requests contained in the appeal petition. The representative of the Capital Markets Authority <orig>هيئة أسواق المال</orig> submitted a memorandum requesting at its conclusion a judgment rejecting the appeal. The representative of the Fatwa and Legislation Department <orig>إدارة الفتوى والتشريع</orig> submitted a memorandum requesting at its conclusion, primarily, a judgment of inadmissibility of the appeal, and alternatively, its rejection. The Court decided to issue its judgment on the appeal in today's session.

### The Rationale
After reviewing the documents, hearing the pleadings, and deliberation.
Whereas the appeal has fulfilled its legally prescribed conditions.
Whereas the appellant faults the appealed judgment for insufficiency of reasoning and corruption in inference, as it ruled on the unconstitutionality of the clause to the extent it generally included what is stipulated in Article (125) of Law No. (7) of 2010 regarding the penalization of "any person who falsely claims that the Authority has taken any measure or decision that it has not actually taken," despite it being tainted by suspicion of unconstitutionality due to the failure to definitively specify the criminalized acts, which prevents their confusion with others, in violation of Articles (30), (32), and (36) of the Constitution.
Whereas this objection is rebutted by what is established – in the jurisprudence of this Court – that the assessment of the seriousness of the plea of unconstitutionality requires the convergence of two necessary conditions: first, that the decision on the constitutional matter is necessary for deciding the substantive dispute; and second, that there is an apparent suspicion of the legislative text, subject of the plea, violating the provisions of the Constitution.
Given this, and since the legislator, by virtue of the challenged text in the aforementioned Law No. (7) of 2010, penalized "any person who falsely claims that the Authority has taken any measure or decision that it has not actually taken," the text was clear in defining the material element required for this crime, which is the performance of a positive act consisting of claiming that the Capital Markets Authority <orig>هيئة أسواق المال</orig> has taken a measure or decision related to its activities exercised in accordance with the provisions of this law, and that it is proven that it did not actually take this measure or decision; if it had indeed taken it, the material element of the crime would not be fulfilled. And since this crime is an intentional crime, this act must be accompanied by criminal intent, which is the perpetrator's will and intention to alter the truth by attributing actions to the Authority that it did not perform, with his knowledge thereof. The burden of proof for the existence of the crime with its elements, as previously stated, lies with the prosecution authority, and the Court is obligated to verify this itself in light of its assessment of the evidence presented to it. Consequently, the objection to the challenged text regarding the lack of clarity and definition of the criminalized acts, which could lead to their confusion with other acts, is a claim not based on a sound premise. And since the appealed judgment concluded that the plea of unconstitutionality was not serious, it has reached a correct conclusion, and the appeal against it is therefore not based on a sound foundation, and thus it must be ruled to be rejected, and the appellant ordered to pay the costs.

### For These Reasons
The Court ruled: to accept the appeal formally, and reject it substantively, and ordered the appellant to pay the costs.

collection receipt No. [R0000044] dated 31/7/2023, for an amount of

and his undertaking to commit to repaying the outstanding debt to the Bank, for which these banking facilities were granted, and based on this, or in good faith, fictitiously in the Company, by virtue of Official Amendment Contract No. 3195/2019 <orig>٣١٩٥ / ٢٠١٩</orig> dated 22/9/2019. However, this partner failed to fulfill his undertaking to repay the value of the banking facilities and caused the applicant company's interests to be disrupted and involved it in legal disputes. Thus, a clear divergence from its anomaly was warranted, and this partner caused the actual owner and manager of the company, Mr. Ibrahim Abdul Nabi Al-Shirazi <orig>إبراهيم عبد النبي الشيرازي</orig>, to be removed by a judicial instrument, which led to the removal of the manager's authority from the company's management and the cessation of its operations and activities. In a serious attempt by the company to salvage the situation with the fictitious companies in order to manage the company's affairs and fulfill its obligations towards third parties, an agreement was reached with him by virtue of an official agreement contract dated 3/1/2021, in which he undertook to be the fourth party responsible for repaying the loan due to the aforementioned Bank (the Banking Facilities Contract). The contract was submitted in one of the dismissed lawsuits by virtue of the agreement's enforceability in Case No. 2056/2020 <orig>٢٠٥٦ / ٢٠٢٠</orig> Commercial Plenary. Based on this judgment, the applicant company sent a letter to the Bank to present its guarantee bond from Mr. Hassan Ali Mohammed Hajja <orig>حسن علي محمد حاجة</orig>, confirming his assumption of the debt and his undertaking to repay it. The aforementioned Bank accepted these interests, but the aforementioned individual did not adhere to what he undertook in the settlement agreement. After its suffering with the fictitious partner, the Court of Cassation <orig>محكمة التمييز</orig> ruled on 14/6/2023 in Appeal No. 2333/2023 <orig>٢٣٣٣ / ٢٠٢٣</orig> Commercial, regarding the fictitious nature of the official company amendment contract documented under No. 3195/2019 <orig>٣١٩٥ / ٢٠١٩</orig>, which is the company amendment contract by virtue of which this fictitious partner joined the applicant company. This judgment heralds the return of the applicant company to its former state of conducting its activities and fulfilling all its obligations, which prompted it to approach the aforementioned Bank to conduct an amicable settlement regarding the outstanding debt by virtue of the assignment of debt that the aforementioned Bank accepted and which is still pending before the judiciary. However, the aforementioned Bank did not facilitate the loyal parties in that lawsuit and proceeded to take enforcement actions against the guarantors, especially Arkan Financial Company (Business) / Arkan Al-Maliya (A'mal) <orig>أركان المالية (أعمال)</orig>.

He also expressed his doubt based on the contract issued by the National Bank of Kuwait <orig>البنك الأهلي الكويتي</orig> and included in his letter that the respondent bank <orig>البنك المقدم ضده</orig> is committed to its pledges regarding part of the mortgage due to it on the property, conditional upon the full price being delivered to it by the National Bank of Kuwait <orig>البنك الأهلي الكويتي</orig>, amounting to (K.D. 2,000,000,000), and that no party has the right to demand its cancellation <orig>التشطيب</orig> before that. Likewise, the bailiff <orig>المحضر</orig> for the respondent bank <orig>البنك المقدم ضده</orig> submitted his letter dated 16/12/2024 AD regarding the request for authorization for the documents submitted, in his capacity, for the disbursement of an amount of (K.D. 223,470.630) related to execution file No. (223470.63), in implementation of the approved preventive settlement agreement <orig>اتفاق التسوية الوقائية المصادق عليه</orig>. He also submitted photocopies of correspondence from Gulf Bank <orig>بنك الخليج</orig> to various entities regarding the property of document No. (13154) and from the aforementioned property document, and a record of the data history of the applicant company's <orig>الشركة الطالبة</orig> agent. He stated that the ownership of the property subject of the request had not been transferred again by virtue of the document, and that violations on the property were mentioned in the document's bank <orig>بنك الوثيقة</orig>, and that he requests the respondent bank <orig>البنك المقدم ضده</orig> to provide them with a letter stating the bank's non-objection to removing the violations on the property so that the procedure can be followed up and the price of the property transferred from the National Bank of Kuwait <orig>البنك الأهلي الكويتي</orig> to the benefit of the respondent bank <orig>البنك المقدم ضده</orig>.

It was noted from reviewing the subsequent disclosure memorandum <orig>مذكرة تالية</orig> and the disclosure of the following procedures, detailing the total amounts supplied to execution file No. (223470.63) dated 7/10/2024 AD and the fifth <orig>الخامس</orig> from the General Department for Mortgage Execution <orig>الإدارة العامة لتنفيذ الرهن</orig> in the documents, that amounts totaling (K.D. 2,000,000) thirty-two thousand Kuwaiti Dinars <orig>اثنان وثلاثون ألف دينار كويتي</orig> were supplied by the applicant company <orig>الشركة الطالبة</orig> to the benefit of the respondent bank <orig>البنك المقدم ضده</orig>.

# Amendment to Some Provisions of the Bankruptcy Law
## Presented Facts

Based on the foregoing work by the Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig>, the papers were presented for disposition, and a decision was issued in accordance with the presented facts.

Whereas it is stipulated in the first paragraph of Article 81 of the Bankruptcy Law <orig>قانون الإفلاس</orig> issued by Law No. 71 of 2020 that: "The debtor <orig>المدين</orig> must, within ten days from the date of approval or rejection of the preventive settlement proposal <orig>مقترح التسوية الوقائية</orig>, notify the Bankruptcy Department <orig>إدارة الإفلاس</orig>, the Supervisor <orig>المراقب</orig>, the Bankruptcy Authority <orig>هيئة الإفلاس</orig>, and the Financial Regulatory Interface <orig>واجهة الرقابة المالية</orig> – as the case may be – of this, attaching the approved or rejected plan, the minutes of the meetings in which the voting took place, any documentation indicating the objections raised, meeting attendance, proof of attendance, and proof of voting. In case of approval of the plan, ratification of the plan must be requested within the notification."

It is also stipulated in Article 82 of the Bankruptcy Law <orig>قانون الإفلاس</orig> that: "The Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> shall, within ten days from the date the Bankruptcy Department <orig>إدارة الإفلاس</orig> receives the notification of the creditors' approval of the preventive settlement proposal <orig>مقترح التسوية الوقائية</orig> and its attachments, ratify the proposal after verifying the fulfillment of the following two conditions: 1- That the proposal has obtained the required majority approval. 2- That the proposal meets the criteria of fairness for the affected creditors <orig>الدائنين المتأثرين</orig>."

It is also stipulated in Article 86 of the Bankruptcy Law <orig>قانون الإفلاس</orig> that: "The preventive settlement proposal <orig>مقترح التسوية الوقائية</orig> ratified by the Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> shall be enforceable against all creditors <orig>الدائنين</orig> covered by it, including those creditors who rejected the proposal and those who did not attend the meeting for voting on the proposal. The Bankruptcy Department <orig>إدارة الإفلاس</orig> shall carry out announcement, publication, notification, disclosure, and registration in accordance with Article (33) of this Law for every decision issued regarding the ratification of the preventive settlement proposal <orig>مقترح التسوية الوقائية</orig>, or the rejection of the proposal, or the suspension of ratification, or the cancellation of procedures, or the commencement of restructuring procedures <orig>إجراءات إعادة الهيكلة</orig>, or the declaration of bankruptcy <orig>شهر الإفلاس</orig>, within ten days from the date of the decision's issuance. The Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> may suffice with registering the decision in the Bankruptcy Register <orig>سجل الإفلاس</orig> and the Commercial Register <orig>السجل التجاري</orig>."

And by Article (87) of the same Law, it is stipulated that: "The debtor <orig>المدين</orig> is obligated to implement the preventive settlement proposal <orig>مقترح التسوية الوقائية</orig> in accordance with what the creditors <orig>الدائنون</orig> approved and the Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> ratified. He is also obligated, within ten days from the date of undertaking the settlement proposal, to notify the Bankruptcy Department <orig>إدارة الإفلاس</orig> of this, attaching to the notification a statement of the debts that have been settled and the method of settlement, as well as attaching the document proving the settlement. The Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> shall issue a decision to that effect. In the event that the debtor <orig>المدين</orig> fails to implement the preventive settlement proposal <orig>مقترح التسوية الوقائية</orig> in accordance with what the creditors <orig>الدائنون</orig> approved and the Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> ratified, or in the event that the debtor fails to notify the Bankruptcy Department <orig>إدارة الإفلاس</orig> of this, or in the event that the debtor fails to submit the document proving the settlement, the Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> may issue a decision to cancel the preventive settlement proposal <orig>مقترح التسوية الوقائية</orig>, or issue a decision to commence restructuring procedures <orig>إجراءات إعادة الهيكلة</orig>, or issue a decision to declare bankruptcy <orig>شهر الإفلاس</orig>. This shall be after hearing the statements of the debtor <orig>المدين</orig>, the Bankruptcy Department <orig>إدارة الإفلاس</orig>, and the Supervisor <orig>المراقب</orig>, and after verifying the fulfillment of the conditions for canceling the preventive settlement proposal <orig>مقترح التسوية الوقائية</orig>, or commencing restructuring procedures <orig>إجراءات إعادة الهيكلة</orig>, or declaring bankruptcy <orig>شهر الإفلاس</orig>."

completion of the implementation of the settlement proposal and termination of preventive settlement procedures within ten days from the date the Bankruptcy Department <orig>إدارة الإفلاس</orig> receives the notification. The second paragraph of Article (86) of this Law applies to the decision. The Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> may request the opinion of the supervisor, if appointed, regarding the completion of the settlement implementation before issuing the aforementioned decision. He may also request the opinion of the Bankruptcy Committee <orig>لجنة الإفلاس</orig> regarding the completion of the settlement implementation, even if the indebtedness is not subject to its supervision, before issuing the aforementioned decision.
Debtors who challenge the validity of what is stated in the debtor's notification regarding the settlement of their indebtedness may appeal the decision referred to in the preceding paragraph. If the request is accepted, the debtor is obligated to implement the preventive settlement proposal, guaranteed by the debtor who accepted its submission, and the preventive settlement proposal and its terms <orig>عقيده</orig> shall apply to this creditor.
In light of the foregoing and proceeding therewith, the applicant company <orig>الشركة الطالبة</orig> had submitted its current request to the Bankruptcy Department <orig>إدارة الإفلاس</orig> to initiate preventive settlement procedures against the creditor bank <orig>البنك المتقدم</orig> regarding its indebtedness for which the request was submitted. After it submitted a memorandum containing a brief description of its economic and financial situation and information about its assets, supported by documents accompanying the request, and the opinion of the Bankruptcy Committee <orig>لجنة الإفلاس</orig> was taken, approved by its decision in Report No. (2023/8) dated 11/9/2023, which concluded that, according to the available documents, the applicant company's situation indicates the possibility of continuing its operations and its ability to pay its outstanding debts if the preventive settlement is accepted, the Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> issued a decision on 17/9/2023 to initiate preventive settlement procedures. The applicant company, after the issuance of the decision to initiate procedures, deposited a copy of the preventive settlement proposal with the Bankruptcy Department <orig>إدارة الإفلاس</orig> and proceeded, during the period of suspension of ordinary claims, to persuade the creditor bank <orig>البنك المتقدم ضده</orig> to agree to the settlement proposal. It attached to the request a letter from the creditor bank <orig>البنك المتقدم ضده</orig> dated 5/2/2024 approving the preventive settlement proposal. A representative of the creditor bank <orig>البنك المتقدم ضده</orig> attended the session on 7/3/2024 and confirmed the bank's approval of that proposal and the payment of the settlement amount according to the method referred to in the said letter. The applicant company had no creditors - as per the documents on file - other than the bank against which the claim was filed regarding the indebtedness in question. Therefore, the Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> issued a decision on 10/3/2024 to ratify the preventive settlement proposal, including what was agreed upon between its parties and endorsed by the Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig>, for the applicant company <orig>الشركة الطالبة</orig> to pay an amount of KWD 2,520,000.

After reviewing the documents and the Secretary's letter dated 2025/4/27, which set a one-month deadline for submitting claims and debts, and in accordance with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Law <orig>قانون الإفلاس</orig> and its Executive Regulations <orig>لائحته التنفيذية</orig>:

- In accordance with Article (8) of the Bankruptcy Law <orig>قانون الإفلاس</orig>, the Court, through the Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig>, decided to pay the costs of initiating the procedures for developing a bankruptcy plan (A) <orig>خطة (أ) الإفلاس</orig> for the executive client. The bankrupt's liability shall be unencumbered and without announcement by the Bankruptcy Committee <orig>لجنة الإفلاس</orig>.
Decision issued in Application No. (2004/23) Bankruptcy <orig>إفلاس</orig>
The facts are encompassed by the two decisions of the Bankruptcy Judge <orig>قاضي الإفلاس</orig> in the present application, issued on 2025/2/17 and 2025/4/10, to open the door for electronic claims for a period of one month starting from the date of publication of the first decision, and to extend the period for submitting electronic claims for an additional month starting from the date of expiry of the previous decision, to which both are referred to avoid repetition.

Whereas the Trustee <orig>الأمين</orig> has requested an extension of the deadline for submitting claims and debts for an additional month, effective from the date of expiry of the last decision, based on the desire of some creditors who were unable to submit their applications during the two previous periods, it was therefore decided to extend the period for submitting claims electronically for an additional month, effective from the date of expiry of the previous decision issued on 10/4/2025.

Therefore, we have decided the following:
1- To extend the period for submitting claims electronically for an additional month, effective from the date of expiry of the previous decision issued on 10/4/2025.
2- The Bankruptcy Department <orig>إدارة الإفلاس</orig> shall provide the Trustee <orig>الأمين</orig> with a certified true copy of this decision, publish and announce it in the Official Gazette <orig>الجريدة الرسمية</orig>, and legally notify the concerned parties.
