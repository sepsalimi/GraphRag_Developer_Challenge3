These are the articles related to the organization of the National Assembly <orig>مجلس الأمة</orig> in the Constitution, the regulation of its participation with His Highness the Amir of the Country <orig>أمير البلاد</orig> in exercising legislative authority, the appointment of ministers from among the Assembly members, and other provisions related to the Assembly, which exist or cease to exist with it. Furthermore, the aforementioned Amiri Order <orig>الأمر الأميري</orig> stipulated in Article (3) that His Highness the Amir <orig>سمو الأمير</orig> and the Council of Ministers <orig>مجلس الوزراء</orig> shall assume the powers vested in the National Assembly <orig>مجلس الأمة</orig>.

Since Law No. 12 of 1963 <orig>القانون رقم 12 لسنة 1963</orig> concerning the Internal Regulations of the National Assembly <orig>اللائحة الداخلية لمجلس الأمة</orig> is the law responsible for regulating the Assembly's work and its committees, its membership provisions and related privileges, the rights and duties of its members, the regulation of its presidency, its bureau, and all its other provisions, and among these texts was Article (39), which stipulates that the National Assembly Bureau <orig>مكتب مجلس الأمة</orig> shall be responsible for the following matters: (c) to establish the rules and provisions regulating the Assembly's administrative and financial affairs and its employees, and otherwise, the applicable laws and regulations in this regard shall apply. It may exercise the powers stipulated for the Council of Ministers <orig>مجلس الوزراء</orig>, the Civil Service Council <orig>مجلس الخدمة المدنية</orig>, the Civil Service Commission <orig>ديوان الخدمة المدنية</orig>, and the Minister of Finance <orig>وزير المالية</orig> in this regard), and Article (176), which stipulated that the General Secretariat of the Assembly <orig>الأمانة العامة للمجلس</orig> shall be organized by a decision of the Speaker after the approval of the Assembly Bureau, and this decision shall include detailed provisions related to administrative, financial, personnel, and stores affairs).

And Article (178), which stipulated that in the event of the dissolution of the National Assembly <orig>مجلس الأمة</orig>, the General Secretariat <orig>الأمانة العامة</orig> shall be attached to the Presidency of the Council of Ministers <orig>رئاسة مجلس الوزراء</orig>).
Consequently, the Speaker of the National Assembly <orig>رئيس مجلس الأمة</orig> issued Decision No. (26) of 2009 <orig>القرار رقم (26) لسنة 2009</orig> approving the Regulations of the Administrative Functional System for Civil Employees of the General Secretariat of the National Assembly <orig>لائحة النظام الإداري الوظيفي للموظفين المدنيين بالأمانة العامة لمجلس الأمة</orig>, and Decision No. (46) of 2014 <orig>القرار رقم (46) لسنة 2014</orig> with the Guide to Policies, Procedures, and Personnel Affairs Systems <orig>دليل السياسات وقواعد إجراءات ونظم شئون الموظفين</orig> regulating the salary and benefits system for these employees. These decisions included provisions contrary to the general law of employment in the state, established by Decree-Law No. 15 of 1979 <orig>المرسوم بقانون رقم 15 لسنة 1979</orig> concerning Civil Service, and the Decree issued in 1979 <orig>المرسوم الصادر سنة 1979</orig> concerning the Civil Service System and its amendments, which apply to all state employees, except for those specifically exempted by a special legal text.
As the National Assembly <orig>مجلس الأمة</orig> was dissolved, and the constitutional provisions related to it were suspended for four years by virtue of the aforementioned Amiri Order <orig>الأمر الأميري</orig>, it consequently followed – by necessity – that the provisions of the aforementioned Law No. 12 of 1963 <orig>القانون رقم 12 لسنة 1963</orig> became suspended and inapplicable. The civil employees of the General Secretariat of the Assembly <orig>الأمانة العامة للمجلس</orig> had been attached to the Presidency of the Council of Ministers <orig>رئاسة مجلس الوزراء</orig> in accordance with the provision of Article (178) of the aforementioned law, and they no longer perform the duties that

</header>

In accordance with the established principle that there is no independent reasoning (ijtihad) where the text is clear, Article One of the present draft explicitly stipulates that the suspension of Law No. 12 of 1963, referred to, is not limited to suspending the operation of its articles only, but rather extends to all decisions and rulings issued based on this law, especially the decisions and rulings regulating the affairs of the staff of the General Secretariat of the National Assembly <orig>الأمانة العامة لمجلس الأمة</orig>.

For the same aforementioned reason, Article Two of the presented draft Decree-Law <orig>المرسوم بقانون</orig> explicitly and clearly stipulated the applicability of the provisions of Decree-Law <orig>المرسوم بقانون</orig> No. 15 of 1979, referred to, and the provisions of the Civil Service System <orig>نظام الخدمة المدنية</orig> to the staff of the General Secretariat of the National Assembly <orig>الأمانة العامة لمجلس الأمة</orig>. It is self-evident that these provisions include all decisions issued by the Civil Service Council or Bureau <orig>مجلس أو ديوان الخدمة</orig> related to public employment affairs, provided that these provisions shall apply from the date of implementation of this Decree-Law <orig>المرسوم بقانون</orig> until the re-implementation of the provisions of Law No. 12 of 1963, referred to, considering that the Civil Service Law and its system represent the general legislation applicable to all state employees, except for those specifically exempted by a special provision.

Article Three of the draft stipulated the repeal of any provision that contradicts its provisions.

Article Four thereof obliged the Prime Minister <orig>رئيس الوزراء</orig> and the Ministers <orig>الوزراء</orig> to implement it, and specified its effective date as the date of its publication in the Official Gazette <orig>الجريدة الرسمية</orig>.
