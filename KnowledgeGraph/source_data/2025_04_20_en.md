### Article One
The texts of Articles (188 and 230) of the aforementioned Code of Criminal Procedures and Trials <orig>قانون الإجراءات والمحاكمات الجزائية</orig> shall be replaced with the following two texts:

### Article (188)
The period for objection <orig>المعارضة</orig> is one week, commencing in misdemeanors from the date the absentee judgment is served on the convicted person. In felonies, it commences from the date of the convicted person's arrest if the judgment has not been served personally. If this period expires without the convicted person filing an objection, the judgment may only be appealed if it is subject to appeal.
The absentee judgment shall be served personally on the convicted person, or via email, or by any other modern communication means capable of storage and retrieval, in accordance with the conditions and controls stipulated in the aforementioned Code of Civil and Commercial Procedures <orig>قانون المرافعات المدنية والتجارية</orig>.
If it is not possible to serve the judgment on the convicted person, the notification shall be delivered at their place of residence to any of their relatives or in-laws residing with them or to any of their followers. If none of them are found, or if those found refuse to receive the notification, the notification shall be published in the Official Gazette <orig>الجريدة الرسمية</orig> and affixed in prominent places in the area where it is located, and in a prominent place at their residence or workplace, and in any other place deemed appropriate for publication.

### Article (230)
If the convicted person fails to pay the fine imposed, it shall be collected through compulsory execution <orig>التنفيذ الجبري</orig> on their assets. The Public Prosecution <orig>النيابة العامة</orig> may collect it through monthly deductions not exceeding one-quarter of the amount the convicted person receives as salary, wage, labor support, or retirement pension.
The President of the court that issued the judgment, or the Public Prosecutor <orig>النائب العام</orig> or their authorized representative, may, upon the request of the convicted person, order the installment payment of the fine amount or its postponement for a reasonable period, provided that justification is presented, provided that the full amount of the fine is paid within five years.

### Article Two
The Ministers – each within their jurisdiction – shall implement this Decree-Law, and it shall be published in the Official Gazette <orig>الجريدة الرسمية</orig> and shall come into force from the date of its publication.

Kuwait Today / Al-Kuwait Al-Youm <orig>الكويت اليوم</orig> No. 1735, Seventy-First Year
Sunday, 22 Shawwal 1446 AH - 20/4/2025 AD
</header>

The substituted Article (230) <orig>المادة (230) المستبدلة</orig> included a provision to address the problem revealed by practical experience regarding the accumulation of criminally imposed fines, which has reached an extreme level, as these amounts have become a heavy burden that is difficult to collect in many cases. What exacerbated the problem is that the failure to collect these fines from convicted persons has resulted in a set of serious legal issues, most notably the statute of limitations for criminal cases <orig>تقادم الدعاوى الجزائية</orig> and the lapse of penalties due to the passage of time <orig>سقوط العقوبات بمضي المدة</orig>. These problems ultimately lead to the state losing its legitimate right to collect these amounts, even though these fines are a right enjoying a general privilege that the public treasury <orig>الخزانة العامة</orig> must collect for the benefit of the nation.
For this reason, the substituted text <orig>النص المستبدل</orig> came to specify more effective procedures for collecting criminal fines. It stipulated that if the convicted person fails to pay the imposed fine, it shall be collected through compulsory enforcement <orig>التنفيذ الجبري</orig> on their assets. It also permitted the Public Prosecution <orig>النيابة العامة</orig> to collect it through monthly deductions not exceeding a quarter of the amount the convicted person receives as salary, wage, employment support <orig>دعم عمالة</orig>, or retirement pension <orig>معاش تقاعدي</orig>. Furthermore, this text granted the authority to the head of the court <orig>رئيس المحكمة</orig> that issued the judgment, or to the Public Prosecutor <orig>النائب العام</orig> or their authorized representative, to order the installment payment or deferral of the adjudicated amount for a reasonable period upon the request of the convicted person, provided they present justification for it, with the full adjudicated amount not to be delayed beyond five years.
This ensures, on the one hand, that these amounts do not accumulate, and on the other hand, prevents the loss of state rights.

The Code of Criminal Procedures and Trials <orig>قانون الإجراءات والمحاكمات الجزائية</orig> is considered one of the fundamental pillars upon which criminal justice <orig>العدالة الجنائية</orig> is based in any society. As such, it is not merely a collection of abstract legal texts, but rather the backbone that carries justice, establishes it in people's minds, and makes it effective in their lives.
While law in general holds great importance in preserving rights and regulating relations between individuals, the Code of Criminal Procedures <orig>قانون الإجراءات الجزائية</orig> acquires special significance because it addresses the mechanism for applying these laws on the ground and formulates the method of applying justice with legal tools that ensure every individual can easily and readily access their rights.
Perhaps one of the greatest roles played by the Code of Criminal Procedures and Trials <orig>قانون الإجراءات والمحاكمات الجزائية</orig> is its emphasis on state sovereignty <orig>سيادة الدولة</orig>. The state cannot achieve true sovereignty unless it has the ability to enforce its laws, execute its judgments, and set the foundations of justice in motion to reach every rights-holder at all times and in all places.
From this, it can be said that the Code of Criminal Procedures and Trials <orig>قانون الإجراءات والمحاكمات الجزائية</orig> is the state's tool for imposing its sovereignty everywhere, and it is the guarantor of embodying the idea of true justice, which does not stop at the texts of the law alone, but finds its reflection in the actual implementation of those texts.
Nevertheless, the practical application of laws is not without challenges. Practical experiences have shown the need to keep pace with developments in communication methods, especially in light of the successful implementation of "electronic notification" <orig>الإعلان الإلكتروني</orig> in notifying lawsuits and appeals in accordance with the provisions of the Civil and Commercial Procedures Law <orig>قانون المرافعات المدنية والتجارية</orig> issued by Decree-Law No. 38 of 1980 <orig>المرسوم بالقانون رقم 38 لسنة 1980</orig>. Furthermore, there are numerous problems related to the collection of criminally imposed fines, which have become a significant obstacle to achieving social and financial justice.
And since the Amiri Order <orig>الأمر الأميري</orig> was issued on 10/5/2024, and Article (4) thereof stipulated that laws shall be issued by decree-laws <orig>مراسيم بقوانين</orig>, therefore, the present draft decree-law <orig>مشروع المرسوم بقانون الماثل</orig> was prepared, and its first article stipulated the replacement of Articles (188, 230) of the Code of Criminal Procedures and Trials <orig>قانون الإجراءات والمحاكمات الجزائية</orig> issued by Law No. 17

In addition to the shareholders, the following gentlemen attended the session:
*   The Ministry of Commerce and Industry <orig>وزارة التجارة والصناعة</orig> was notified of the date of the company's General Assembly meeting, and the Ministry confirmed its awareness of the meeting date by virtue of the extract attached to these minutes.
*   The Kuwait Clearing Company <orig>الشركة الكويتية للمقاصة</orig> apologized for not attending.

After the quorum was met with the attendance of 2,500,000 shares, in person and by proxy, representing 100% of the company's 2,500,000 shares with a capital of KWD 250,000, the discussion of the agenda items commenced. The Extraordinary General Assembly unanimously approved these items as follows:

1.  The future of the company was discussed as follows:
    *   The capital will be increased by KWD 250,000 in cash.
