  },
  {
    "question": "What is the maximum duration of a commercial lease?",

  },
  {
    "question": "What is the filing fee for an appeal in civil court?",
    "answer": "The provided notices don’t state any filing fees. They only mention a 37‑day window to object or appeal after publication; no amounts are given.\n\nTo find the filing fee for a civil appeal, please check the civil court’s official fee schedule (Registry Department) or the Kuwait Ministry of Justice.
