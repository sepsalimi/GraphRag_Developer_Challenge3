   "type": "objective",
   "category": "relational",
   "source_file": "13-4-2025_en.md",
   "answer": "The amendment leaves the statutory-reserve rule unchanged and preserves the optional-reserve as a discretionary GA-approved deduction. Specifically, Article 46 as amended provides:\n\n- Statutory reserve: \"10% (ten percent) of net profits shall be deducted and allocated to the statutory reserve account. The General Assembly may cease this deduction if the statutory reserve exceeds half of the company's capital.\"  \n- Optional reserve: \"A percentage shall be deducted and allocated to the optional reserve account, proposed by the Board of Directors and approved by the General Assembly. This deduction shall be ceased by a resolution of the General Assembly based on a proposal from the Board of Directors.\"\n\nNotably, the amended Article 46 (as adopted) (a) mandates a 10% statutory-reserve deduction (subject to suspension once the reserve > 1/2 the capital) and (b) keeps the optional reserve as a Board‑proposed/General‑Assembly‑approved, stoppable deduction — with no specific percentage limit stated in the amended Article for the optional reserve.  \n\nSource: Minutes of the Extraordinary General Assembly Meeting, National United Real Estate Company (K.S.C.C.), 25 March 2025; Official Gazette (2025-04-13), Article 46 (amended), pages 89–89."

   "question": "Under what conditions is a holding company jointly and severally liable for the debts of its subsidiary companies?",
   "type": "objective",
   "category": "relational",
   "source_file": "13-4-2025_en.md",
   "answer": "General rule (short): A holding company is not automatically liable for the debts of its subsidiaries; each company has a separate legal personality and separate financial liability. A holding company will be held jointly and severally liable for a subsidiary’s debts only in one or more of the following conditions:\n\n- Contractual assumption or guarantee: the holding company expressly assumes the subsidiary’s obligation (e.g., signs the loan, issues an unlimited guarantee, pledge, letter of comfort that legally binds it, or signs as co‑debtor). In that situation the holding company is a co‑obligor and is jointly and severally liable.\n\n- Joint contract / co‑obligation: the holding company and subsidiary enter into a contract that creates joint and several obligations (e.g., joint borrowing, joint supply contract).\n\n- Agency/principal relationship: the subsidiary acts as the holding company’s agent or the third party reasonably relied on the holding company as principal (holding company controlled, directed, and represented the transaction), such that the holding company is the true principal of the obligations.\n\n- Alter‑ego / piercing the corporate veil (fraud or abuse): courts treat parent and subsidiary as one when the holding company so dominated and controlled the subsidiary and used it to perpetrate fraud or injustice. Typical factors supporting veil piercing include extreme domination of management, commingling of assets, lack of separate corporate records or formalities, undercapitalization of the subsidiary, using the subsidiary to evade existing obligations, and diversion/stripping of assets to frustrate creditors.\n\n- Fraudulent transfers / asset stripping: transfers of the subsidiary’s assets to the holding company (or other parties) intended to defeat creditors can be reversed and may expose the holding company to liability for the subsidiary’s debts.\n\n- Direct participation in wrongful acts (tort): where the holding company itself directed, participated in or controlled the tortious conduct (product defect, negligence, unsafe operations) that gave rise to the claim, it can be held directly liable (joint and several) with the subsidiary.\n\n- Statutory or regulatory provisions: specific laws or regulations may impose joint and several liability on parents/controllers for particular obligations (tax, social security, labor, environmental liability, banking/financial regulations) where those statutes so provide.\n\n- Insolvency / bankruptcy remedies against controllers: where bankruptcy/insolvency procedures establish control, fraudulent conduct, or other grounds entitling the trustee or court to extend liability beyond the corporate entity, the holding company (or controlling persons) may be held liable for subsidiary debts under bankruptcy law and its executive regulations.\n\n- Liability through persons who are common managers/directors: where the holding company itself acts through persons who are directors/managers and those persons committed breaches of duty that caused the subsidiary’s debts, remedies against responsible persons (and indirectly the holding) may follow where law permits.\n\nPrimary legal authorities (Kuwait): Commercial Companies Law No. 1 of 2016, its amendments, and its executive regulations; Bankruptcy Law No. 71 of 2020 and its executive regulations. Case law establishes the default rule of separate corporate personality and the exceptions described above (e.g., Appeal No. 1053/2004; Appeal No. 1022/2003 — cited in Official Gazette materials applying the principle of separate liability but recognizing veil‑piercing and director/controller liability in appropriate cases)."
